## Motivation & Methods

Cannabis is becoming increasingly popular as a medication to relieve pain and has been legalized in various countries to help patients. Since cannabis poses less serious side effects than most opioid drugs, it was worth researching whether it can replace opioids in the future. As our method, we will use a linear regression model to find the correlation between the number of opioid related deaths and the number of cannabis patients with **R** and graphical SAS software. Additionally, a 2 sample t-test will be performed to compare the population of legalized and illegalized marijuana States, which would help determine the significance of whether legalized cannabis affected the number of opioid overdoses.

## Summary & Results

Our goal was to see whether an increase in cannabis patients would decrease the number of opioid related deaths. However, we got a positive correlation with a **R-squared of 0.47**. In otherwords, we concluded that an increase in cannabis patients also had an increase in opioid related deaths which indicates that medical cannabis will not be fixing opioid crisis in North America as of 2019. Also, from our 2 sample t-test we recieved a **p-value of 0.53**, which means that we failed to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there was **no significant difference** between legalized and illegalized marijuana States on opioid overdoses. 

## Additional notes & Future improvements

This was our first attempt on applying statistic models to large datasets and there were definetly a lot of factors that gave us inacurate results. We were unsure on how to clean, transform, and preprocess the data, so there were a lot of errors in the analysis. Since cannabis was only legalized in October of 2019 in Canada, we will require much more long term data to predict whether there is an impact in opioid related drugs.

**As of 2023**, this article by Medscape (https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/986790?form=fpf) indicates that more than half of the patients with chronic pain has reduced the usage of other pain relief medications including opioid drugs, and has started using medical cannabis more.
